complementation imply that the theorems of set usually come in pairs. If in an inclusion equation involving unions, intersections, and complements of subsets of $E$ we replace each set by its complement, interchange unions and intersections, and reverse all  inclusions, the result is other theorem. This fact is sometimes referred to as the \textit{principle of duality} for sets.

Here are some easy exercises on complementation. 

\begin{center}
$A — B = A \cap B'.$

$A \subset B \text{ \textit{ if and only if } } A — B = \emptyset .$

$A — (A — B) = A \cap B.$

$A \cap (B — C) = (A \cap B) — (A \cap C).$

$A \cap B  \subset (A \cap C) \cup (B \cap C').$

$(A \cup C) \cap (B \cup C') \subset A \cup B$
\end{center}

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, the s\textit{symmetric difference} (Or \textit{Boolean sum}) of $A$ and $B$ is the set $A + B$ defined 

\begin{equation*}
A + B = (A — B) \cup (B — A). 
\end{equation*}

This operation is commutative $(A + B = B + A)$ and associative $(A + (B + C) =  (A + B) + C)$, and is such that $A + \emptyset = A$ and $A + A = \emptyset$.

This may be the right time to straighten out a trivial but occasionally puzzling part of the theory of intersections. Recall, to begin with, that intersections were defined for non-empty collections only. The reason is that the same approach to the empty collection does not define a set. Which $x'$s are specified by the sentence 

\begin{equation*}
x \in X \text{ \textit{ for every } } X \: in \: \emptyset ? 
\end{equation*}


As usual for questions about $ \emptyset $ the answer is easier to see for the corresponding negative question. Which $x$'s do \textit{not} satisfy the stated condition? If it is not true that $x \in X$ for every $X$ in $\emptyset$, then there must exist an $X$ in $\emptyset$ such that $x \notin X$; since, however, there do not exist any $X$'s in $ \emptyset $ at all, this is absurd. Conclusion: no $x$ fails to satisfy the stated condition, or, equivalently, every $x$ does satisfy it. In other words, the $x$'s that the condition specifies exhaust the (nonexistent) universe. There is no profound problem here; it is merely a nuisance to be forced always to be making
