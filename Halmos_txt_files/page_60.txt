if the considerations that the proof involves seem to be pathological and foreign to the arithmetic spirit that we expect to see in the theory of natural numbers, the end justifies the means. The second proposition refers to behavior thet is quite similar to the one just excluded. This time, however, the apparently artificial considerations end in an affirmative result: something mildly surprising always does happen. The statements are as follows: (i) \textit{no natural number is a subset of any of its elements}, and  (ii) \textit{every element of a natural number is a subset of it}. Sometimes a set with the property that it includes ($\subset$) everything that it contains ($\in$) is called a \textit{transitive} set. More precisely, to say that $E$ is transitive means that if $x \in y$ and $y \in E$, then $x \in E$. (Recall the slightly different use of the word that we encountered in the of relations.) In this language, (ii) says that every natural number is transitive. 

The proof of (i) is a typical application of the principle of mathematical induction. Let $S$ be the set of all those natural numbers that are not included in any of their elements. (Explicitly: $n \in S$ if and only if $n \in \omega$ and $n$ is not a subset of $x$ for any $x$ in $n$.) Since $0$ is not a subset of any of its elements, it follows that $0 \in S$.  Suppose now that $n \in S$. Since $n$ is a subset of $n$, we may infer that $n$ is not an element of $n$, and hence that $n^{+}$ is not a subset of $n$. What can $n^{+}$ be a subset of? If $n^{+} \subset x$,then $n \subset x$, and therefore (since $n \in S$) $x \notin n$. It follows that $n^{+}$ cannot be a subset of $n$, and $n^{+}$ cannot be a subset of any element of $n$. This means that $n^{+}$ cannot be a subset of any element of $n^{+}$, and hence that $n^{+} \in S$. The desired conclusion (i) is now a consequence of \eqref{eq12.3}. 

The proof of (ii) is also inductive. This time let $S$ be the set of all transitive natural numbers. (Explicitly: $n \in S$ if and only if $n \in \omega$ and $x$ is a subset of $n$ for every $x$ in $n$.) The requirement that $0 \in S$ is vacuously satisfied.  Suppose now that $n \in S$. If $x \in n^{+}$, then either $x \in n$ or $x = n$. In the first case $x \subset n$ (since $n \in S$) and therefore $x \subset n^{+}$; in the second case $x \subset n^{+}$ for even more trivial reasons. It follows that every element of $n^{+}$ is a subset of $n^{+}$, or, in other words, that $n^{+} \in S$. The desired conclusion (ii) is a consequence of \eqref{eq12.3}. 

We are now ready to prove \eqref{eq12.5}. Suppose indeed that $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers and that $n^{+} = m^{+}$. Since $n \in n^{+}$ it follows that $n \in m^{+}$, and hence that either $n \in m$ or $n = m$. Similarly, either $m \in n$ or $m = n$. If $n \neq m$, then we must have $n \in m$ and $m \in n$. Since, by (ii), $n$ is transitive, it follows that $n \in n$. Since, however, $n \subset n$, this contradicts (i), and the proof is complete. 

The assertions \eqref{eq12.1}â€”\eqref{eq12.4} are known as the Peano axioms; they used to be considered as the fountainhead of all mathematical knowledge. From
