harmless if the letter used has already been used with "for some—." Recall that "for some $x (x \in A)$" means the same as  "for some $ y (y \in A)$"; it follows that a judicious change of notation will always avert alphabetic collisions.)

We are now ready to formulate the major principle of set theory, often referred to by its German name $Aussonderungsaxiom$. 

\begin{named}[Axiom of specification. ] To every set $A$ and to every condition $S(x)$ corresponds a set $B$ whose elements are exactly those elements $x$ of $A$ for which $S(x)$ holds.
\end{named}

A "condition" here is just a sentence. The symbolism is intended to indicate the letter $x$ is /textit{free} in the sentence $S(x)$; that means that $x$ occurs in $S(x)$ at least once without being introduced by one of the phrases "for some $x$" or "for all $x$". It is an immediate consequence of the axiom of extension that the axiom of specification determines the set $B$ uniquely. To indicate the way $B$ is obtained from $A$ and from $S(x)$ it is customary to write 

\begin{equation*}
B  = \{ x \in A: S(x) \} 
\end{equation*}

To obtain an amusing and instructive application of the axiom of specification, consider, in the role of $S(x)$, the sentence

\begin{equation*}
not (x \in x)
\end{equation*}

It will be convenient, here and throughout, to write "$x \notin  A$" (alternatively "$ x \notin A $") instead of "not $(x \in A)$"; in this notation, the role of $S(x)$ is now played by

\begin{equation*}
x \notin x.
\end{equation*}

It follows that, whatever the set $A$ may be, if $B = {x \in A: x \notin x}$, then, for all $y$,
%Preciso saber como botar um asterisco nessa equação pra referenciar ela
\begin{equation*}
y \in B if and only if ( y \in A and y \notin y).
\end{equation*}

Can it be that $B \in A$? We proceed to prove that the answer is no. Indeed, if $B \in A$, then either $B \in B$ also (unlikely, but not obviously impossible), or else $B \notin B$. If $B \in B$, then, by (*), the assumption $B \in A$ yields $B \notin B$—a contradiction. If $B \notin B$, then, by (*) again, the assumption $B \in A$ yields $B \in B$—a contradiction again. This completes the proof that is impossible, so that we must have $B \notin A$. The most interesting part of this conclusion is that there exists something (namely $B$) that doesnot belong to $A$. The set $A$ in this argument was quite arbitrary. We have proved, in other words, that 

\begin{equation*}
nothing contains everything,
\end{equation*}
