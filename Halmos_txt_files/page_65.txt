that $m \in n$ is that $m \subset n$. Indeed, the implication from $m \in n$ to $m \subset n$ is just the transitivity of $n$. If, conversely, $m \subset n$ and $m \neq n$, then $n \in m$ cannot happen (for then $m$ would be a subset of one of its elements), and therefore $m \in n$. If $m \in n$, or if, equivalently, $m$ is a proper subset of $n$, we shall write $m < n$ and we shall say that $m$ is \textit{less} than $n$. If $m$ is known to be either less than $n$ or else equal to $n$, we write $m \le n$. Note that $\le$ and $<$ are relations in $\omega$. The former is reflexive, but the latter is not; neither is symmetric; both are transitive. If $m \le n$, and $n \le m$, then $m = n$.

\begin{named}[Exercise]. Prove that if $m < n$, then $m + k < n + k$, and prove that if $m < n$ and $k \neq 0$, then $m \dot k <n \dot k$. Prove that if $E$ is a non-empty set of natural numbers, then there exists an element $k$ in $E$ such that $k \le m$ for all $m$ in $E$.

Two sets $E$ and $F$ (not necessarily subsets of $\omega$) are called \textit{equivalent}, in symbols $E \sim F$, if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between them. It is easy to verify that equivalence in this sense, for subsets of some particular set $X$, is an equivalence relation in the power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$.

Every proper subset of a natural number $n$ is equivalent to some smaller natural number (i.e , to some element of $n$). The proof of this assertion is inductiv. For $n = 0$ it is trivial. If it is true for $n$, and if $E$ is a proper subset of $n^{+}$, then either $E$ is a proper subset of $n$ and the induction hypothesis applies, or $E = n$ and the result is trivial, or $n \in E$. In the latter case, find a number $k$ in $n$ but not in $E$ and define a function $f$ on $E$ by writing $f(i) = i$ when $i$ $i \neq n$ and $f(n) = k$. Clearly $f$ is one-to-one and $f$ maps $E$ into $n$. It follows that the image of $E$ under $f$ is either equal to $n$ or (by the induction hypothesis) equivalent to some element of $n$, and, consequently, $E$ itself is always equivalent to some element of $n^{+}$. 

It is a mildly shocking fact that a set can be equivalent to a proper subset of itself. If, for instance, a function $f$ from $\omega$ to $\omega$ is defined by writing $f(n) = n^{+}$ for all $n$ in $\omega$, then $f$ is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all natural numbers and the proper subset consisting of the non-zero natural numbers. It is nice to know that even though the set of all natural numbers has this peculiar property, sanity prevails for each particular natural number. In other words, if $n \in \omega$, then $n$ is not equivalent to a proper subset of $n$. For $n = 0$ this is clear. Suppose now that it is true for $n$, and suppose that $f$ is a one-to-one correspondence from $n^{+}$ to a proper subset $E$ of $n^{+}$. If $n \notin E$, then the restriction of $f$ to $n$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $n$ and a proper subset of $n$, which contradicts the induction hypothesis. If $n \in E$, then $n$ is equivalent to $E - \{ n \}$, so that, by the induction
