the singleton $\{ \emptyset \}$. The power sets of singletons and paira are also easily describable; we have 

\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P} ( \{ a \} ) = \{ \emptyset, \{ a \} \} 
\end{equation*}

and 

\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P} ( \{ a, b \} ) = \{ \emptyset, \{ a \} , \{ b \} , \{ a,b \} \} .
\end{equation*}

The power set of a triple has eight elements. The reader cen probably guess (and is hereby challenged to prove) the generalization that includes all these stetements: the power set of a finite set with, say, $n$ elements has $2^{n}$ elements. (Of course concepts like "finite" and "$2^{n}$" have no official standing for us yet; this should not prevent them from being unofficially understood.) The occurrence of $n$ as an exponent (the $n$-th power of 2) has something to do with the reason why power set bears its name. 

If $ \mathcal{C} $ is a collection of subsets of a set $E$ (that is, $ \mathcal $ is a subcollection of $ \mathcal{P} (E) $), then write D = 

\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{D} = \{ X \in \mathcal{P} (E): X' \in mathcal{C} \} .
\end{equation*}

(To be certain that the condition used in the definition of $ \mathcal{D} $ is a sentence in the precise technical sense, it must be rewritten in something like the form 

\begin{equation*}
for /: some /: Y \[ Y \in \mathcal{C} /: and /: for /: all /: x ( x \in X if /: and /: only ? if (x \in E /: and /: x \notin Y)) \] .  
\end{equation*}

Similar comments often apply when we wish to use defined abbreviations instead of logical and set-theoretic primitives only. The translation rarely requires any ingenuity and we shall usually omit it.) It is customary to denote the union and the intersection of the collection $ \mathcal{D} $ by the symbols  

\begin{equation*}
\bigcup_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X' \: and \: \bigcap_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X' .
\end{equation*}

In this notation the general forms of the De Morgan lawg become 

\begin{equation*}
( \bigcup_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X)' = \bigcap_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X' .
\end{equation*}

and 

\begin{equation*}
( \bigcap_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X)' = \bigcup_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X' .
\end{equation*}

The proofs of these equationg gre immediate consequences of the appro priate definitions. 

\begin{named}[EXERCISE.  ] Prove that $ \mathcal{P} (E) \cap \mathcal{P} (F) = \mathcal{P}(E \cap F) $ and $ \mathcal{P} (E) \cup \mathcal{P} (F) \subset \mathcal{P}(E \cup F) $ These assertions can be generalized to 

\begin{equation*}
\bigcap_{X \in \mathcal{C}} \mathcal{P} (X) = \mathcal{P} ( \bigcap_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X) .
\end{equation*}

and

\begin{equation*}
\bigcup_{X \in \mathcal{C}} \mathcal{P} (X) \subset \mathcal{P} ( \bigcup_{X \in \mathcal{C}} X) ;
