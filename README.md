# Halmos Naive Set Theory Reedition with OCR and LaTeX

  In this notebook, we will use Optimal Character Recognition (OCR) with Python to help us "translate" the digitilized book Naive Set Theory by Paul Halmos into a PDF with a new and more interactable format.

  There is two reasons for this project: first, the book in digitilized state is perfectly readable, but it doesn't allow search words with Cntrl + F and doesn't have a summary with it. The second reason is purely personal, I have a passion and gratitude for this book and, while I want to learn OCR, I decided to re-edited it as a homage.

  The PDF used is public domain and, so, freely available in the internet. Therefore, the resulting re-edition of the book at the end of this project has no lucrative ends by any means. The final PDF will be written in LaTeX and available for download in the repository.

All chapters finished and the final version of the book available in the pdf "Naive_Set_Theory_Reedition".
